In this one, we&rsquo;d like to elaborate on what OSDLabs stands to do and how <em>you</em> can be a part of it. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Open Source Development Labs is an initiative to bring Open Source innovation to campus.</p>

<p>We have always believed in sharing code and building better software. <strong>Period</strong>. This is what &lsquo;Open Source&rsquo; fundamentally means. To freely collaborate and code.</p>

<p>However, this can only be done when everyone comes together with the best of intentions to bring out something significant.</p>

<p><em>Shouldn’t campus software be written by students?</em></p>

<p><em>Shouldn’t we be pursuing cool projects to make our lives easier?</em></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve always felt you&rsquo;d like to be a part of something bigger in the grand scale of things, this is the right place for you. We are setting out to nurture a community where students <strong>tinker</strong>, <strong>hack</strong> and <strong>design</strong> together.
The diverse thoughts, ideas and methodologies flying around, inherently set up a great environment for innovation.
Don&rsquo;t be alarmed by your capabilities. <em>Anyone</em> with a skillset can contribute to OSDLabs. We will be hosting more educational sessions over the semester as you get to explore domains and find your interests.</p>

<p>Campus infrastructure developments require the faculty and students to bring about disruptive change <strong>together</strong>. We are in plans to set up this ‘seamless’ process, a flexible system where people easily take up interesting projects and hack away. You will get the opportunity to work under experienced mentors and gain exposure while committing to fruitful work.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more developments as we will be releasing some pretty exciting stuff in the coming weeks!</p>

<p>If you have any queries in mind or would simply like to discuss an idea, feel free to message us on our Slack <a href="http://bitsgoacodes.slack.com/signup">channel</a>.</p>
