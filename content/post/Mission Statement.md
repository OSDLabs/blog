We believe in sharing code and building better software. **Period**.
This can only be done when everyone comes together with the best of intentions to bring out something significantly useful.
We believe there should be a community where students tinker, hack and design together.

Already diverse in culture, the sundry thoughts, ideas and methodologies flying around in such a community, clearly set up a great environment for innovation.

We have always believed that the faculty and students can together bring about disruptive change, in and outside college with their synergistic team efforts. It should become this ‘seamless’ process, a flexible system where people easily take up interesting projects and hack.

*Shouldn’t campus software be written by students?*

*Shouldn’t we be making cool software to make our lives easier?*

Wouldn’t it be awesome to have robots flying about? IoT sensors setup to track and detect student activities and generate useful statistics.

*Shouldn’t an engineering college, along with guiding its students, also leverage  their potential for greater causes?*

Whatever BITS might be, **OSDLabs** is a place like no other.
That is exactly what we expect to make of our community. 
Imagine a group of elitists; giving rise to Design studios, Digital Consultancy Services and an infinite GSoC streak!
It is important to note that I expect OSDLabs to be a place of constant learning. There is always some skillset to expand here.
