Hey guys! We're all really excited about our first blog post. 
In this one, we'd like to elaborate on what OSDLabs stands to do and how *you* can be a part of it. For those of you who don't know, Open Source Development Labs is an initiative to bring Open Source innovation to campus.

We have always believed in sharing code and building better software. **Period**. This is what 'Open Source' fundamentally means. To freely collaborate and code.

However, this can only be done when everyone comes together with the best of intentions to bring out something significant.

*Shouldn’t campus software be written by students?*

*Shouldn’t we be pursuing cool projects to make our lives easier?*

If you've always felt you'd like to be a part of something bigger in the grand scale of things, this is the right place for you. We are setting out to nurture a community where students **tinker**, **hack** and **design** together.
The diverse thoughts, ideas and methodologies flying around, inherently set up a great environment for innovation.
Don't be alarmed by your capabilities. *Anyone* with a skillset can contribute to OSDLabs. We will be hosting more educational sessions over the semester as you get to explore domains and find your interests. 

Campus infrastructure developments require the faculty and students to bring about disruptive change **together**. We are in plans in setting up this ‘seamless’ process, a flexible system where people easily take up interesting projects and hack away. You will get the opportunity to work under experienced mentors and gain exposure while committing to fruitful work.

Stay tuned for more developments as we will be releasing some pretty exciting stuff in the coming weeks!
